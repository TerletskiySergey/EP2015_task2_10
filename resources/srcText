In the little volume called The Famous Men of Rome you have read about the great empire which the Romans established.
Now we come to a time when the power of Rome was broken and tribes of barbarians who lived north of the Danube and the Rhine took possession of lands that had been part of the Roman Empire.
These tribes were the Goths, Vandals, Huns, Franks and Anglo-Saxons.
From them have come the greatest nations of modern times.
All except the Huns belonged to the same race and are known as Teutons.
They were war-like, savage and cruel.
They spoke the same language--though in different dialects--and worshiped the same gods.
Like the old Greeks and Romans they had many gods.
Woden, who was also called Odin, was the greatest of all.
His name means "mighty warrior," and he was king of all the gods.
He rode through the air mounted on Sleipnir, an eightfooted horse fleeter than the eagle.
When the tempest roared the Teutons said it was the snorting of Sleipnir.
When their ships came safely into port they said it was Woden's breath that had filled their sails and wafted their vessels over the blue waters.
Thor, a son of Woden, ranked next to him among the gods.
He rode through the air in a chariot drawn by goats.
The Germans called him Donar and Thunar, words which are like our word thunder.
From this we can see that he was the thunder god.
In his hand he carried a wonderful hammer which always came back to his hand when he threw it.
It's head was so bright that as it flew through the air it made the lightning.
When it struck the vast ice mountains they reeled and splintered into fragments, and thus Thor's hammer made thunder.
